        title: 'The best place in the world to see rainbows is in Hawaii',
        post: "If you're an avid rainbow gazer and want to get your fill of the beautiful phenomenon, look no further than the state of Hawaii. A study published by the American Meteorological Society in 2021 noted that the area's 'mountains produce sharp gradients in clouds and rainfall, which are key to abundant rainbow sightings.' Air pollution, pollen, and a large amount of cresting waves also help to put Hawaii at the top of the list when it comes to rainbow quantity and quality.",

        title: 'New creatures have been found in deep-sea volcanoes.',
        post: "Finding previously undiscovered organisms in the depths of the ocean may sound like something straight out of a sci-fi horror film, but a 2020 study of a deep-sea volcano near New Zealand, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, uncovered 'over 90 putative bacterial and archaeal genomic families and nearly 300 previously unknown genera.' Some research has linked hydrothermal vents, like deep-sea volcanoes, to the 'origin of life.' So are we looking at the early signs of future land-dwellers? We'll have to wait and see.",

        title: 'Climate change is causing flowers to change color.',
        post: "Don't worry, your prized red roses aren't going to turn turquoise overnight, but an increase in UV radiation due to the ozone layer deteriorating over the past decades has caused flowers all over the globe to change. A 2020 study led by Clemson University scientists determined that the UV pigmentation in flowers has increased over time which has led to the degradation of their pollen. Although we can't see the color change with our eyes, it is a big problem for pollinators like bees who are attracted to the bright colors that flowers produce.",

        title: "The Earth's ozone layer will make a full recovery in 50 years.",
        post: "Because of pollution, the Earth's ozone layer has suffered a lot. That's bad news for everyone, since the fragile gas layer protects our planet and shields us from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. Fortunately, climate change experts believe that the ozone layer will fully heal within 50 years, according to a 2018 report from the United Nations. The recovery is thanks in large part to the Montreal Protocol of 1987, which put a global ban on the use of one of the main culprits for the damage: chlorofluorocarbons (CFOs). Previously, CFOs had been common in refrigerators, aerosol cans, and dry-cleaning chemicals.",
